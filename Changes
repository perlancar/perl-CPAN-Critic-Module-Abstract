Revision history for CPAN-Critic-Module-Abstract

0.04     2014-08-16 (SHARYANTO) - Happy 19th CPAN Day!

         - [build] CLI scripts are now generated automatically using
           Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ScriptFromFunc. The plugin is still at 0.01 so the
           generated script is not as polished as it should be. Stay tuned.

         - Rename CLI script.


0.03     2014-07-22 (SHARYANTO)

         - No functional changes.

         - Switch CLI scripts from using Perinci::CmdLine to
           Perinci::CmdLine::Any to reduce size of dependencies.


0.02     2012-08-09 (SHARYANTO)

         - Catch redundant phrase 'Perl XS binding for' and 'Perl interface for'
           [suggested by Ben Bullock].

         - Rename function/command name (critique is the verb).

         - Add policy: just_module_name.

         - Adjust to Perinci::Sub::DepChecker 0.07.


0.01     2012-07-17 (SHARYANTO)

         - First release.
